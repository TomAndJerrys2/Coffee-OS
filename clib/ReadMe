These Libraries were developed and written solely by Kyle Brady.

A lot of it, and probably most of it - is indeed re-inventing the wheel.
I knew that from the get go, but this wasn't about trying to make something new and shiny. 
I really wanted to learn the fundamental concepts and I wanted to learn them well. That's where the
idea of Coffee-OS came about, just wanting to learn.

The idea of using my own libraries as well sounded satisfying,
so I thought why not and decided to start at the foundations and make my own \"Standard library"\

The Coffee OS Is designed to be both fast and powerful. I wanted to something that I could use for
development and gaming but also something that was really well built and really modular. The goal in
mind was a super-modular design. Almost like LEGO, I wanted it to be really design-friendly in the sense
that it had a really nice, simple Graphical Interface that was highly customizable to the users needs and a
powerhouse of various tools and integrated softwares that assisted with a variety of tasks.

Most of the library is written in C. While parts of the project are written in C++, most of the code written
here has direct compatibility between compilers anyway

Custom Implementations:
Most of this custom library has basic features that can be reworked. Most of it however is bespokely tailored
to the Operating systems needs. With that being said I implemented a lot of features (even the niche ones) and I do
mean quite a lot. I've covered the whole range of the library (Not including the software available in other repos)
in this ReadMe file. Enjoy!

Data Structures:

There are several data-structures available
