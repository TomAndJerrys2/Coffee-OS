# Coffee OS

Coffee OS Is a simple Operating system built on a Custom kernel driver built primarily
in C and C++. This is a passion project unlike any other, when building things from scratch
you really have no idea where to start. A lot of it was hard memory-management and complex
operational design patterns but my brain eventually stopped resisting and it started to become clearer.

-> A Custom Built Operating System and Kernel also Linking:

[User Interface For the multi-console emulator]

- https://github.com/TomAndJerrys2/Coffee-UI

[Lightweight text editor like notepad with extended functionailty]

- https://github.com/TomAndJerrys2/Coffee-Editor

[Multi-console emulator]

- https://github.com/TomAndJerrys2/Coffee-Emulator

[Full-Stack Web Application for Managing SQL Databases]

- https://github.com/TomAndJerrys2/Coffee-SQL

[Full-Stack Web Application + Backend client for communication]

- https://github.com/TomAndJerrys2/Coffee-Chat

- Browser (CoffeeSurf),
- Virtual Container system (similar to docker - VirtualBean)
- CoffeeLang (Native CoffeeOS and Cross-Platform Programming Language)

The CoffeeOS Passion-Project feature's a rich array of inbuilt features and reusable
examples for future projects. For example, rewriting a standard library for C taught me
the most about real data structure and algorithm implementations found in `clib`

# Components

While striving for performance and rich-enhancements it is important to remember the
importance of refactorability. With the design of component mounts CoffeeOS becomes
a playground for tinkers and programmers alike.

This project will keep being updated - as I am continuing to learn a lot during the process
of building (but mostly struggling) an entire operating system

# Current Updates

- Working on implementing NTFS (or some file system)
- Custom Hash table for command codes
