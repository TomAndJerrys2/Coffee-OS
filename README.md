Coffee OS Is a simple Operating system built on a Custom kernel driver built primarily
in C and C++. This is a passion project unlike any other, when building things from scratch
you really have no idea where to start. A lot of it was hard memory-management and complex
operational design patterns but my brain eventually stopped resisting and it started to become clearer.

A Custom Built Operating System and Kernel also Linking:

- Browser (CoffeeSurf),
- Virtual Container system (similar to docker - VirtualBean)
- CoffeeLang (Native CoffeeOS and Cross-Platform Programming Language)
- Custom Library Implementation(s) in /src/clib

This and everything in it are mainly passion projects. Maintainability will be a question of whether I keep adding features, which I most likely will!
